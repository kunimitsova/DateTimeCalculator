DateTimeCalculator

Does private mean nobdy can see it? Can I un-private certain items? Wee will test this using this document.

The Date-Time Calculator app came out of my constant need to know what day "90 days from today" or "120 days from last [event]" is.

It does not collect any user data.
It does collect device data required to render the app properly. (available screen size, folding options, etc.)
It does not save any data entered by a user anywhere.

This app is in progress.

I am not a Kotlin or Android expert, so the code may not be the most effective. But also, it might be.
